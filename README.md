# Clojure! Then you think...

You've jumped into Clojure or ClojureScript programming because it sounds cool, or
because you read a great blog post. Or maybe your boss told you to learn it now. Or...

You've read some websites. Maybe you've already created a _hello word_. You are ready to
dig deeper, but there is so much to read; so many interesting libraries; so many ways to
structure your application. What's next??

Like we all know, _Objects in the mirror may be Clojure. Then you think._.  Or, maybe
that's not exactly the line. In any event, once you get past the awful puns, I hope you
find some useful resources here.

This project is still mostly empty. I hope to fill it soon with guides to getting
started in the Clojure family of languages, with an emphasis on web-centric programming
in ClojureScript.

A few initial documents:

- A [comparison chart](https://goo.gl/ZZH8fm) of templates and frameworks for
  ClojureScript web programming.
- A [brainstorming doc](https://goo.gl/iqNrny) of ideas to enhance ClojureScript
  documentation. I hope that these ideas will move into this project soon.
- The [slack](https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/C5JCE7VGF/) discussion about this.
